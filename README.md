# Mars
The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather. Scientists have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.
